# Monte Carlo Project – Overview

This repo re-implements parts of my undergraduate Monte Carlo project (module mark: 68%).  
Goal: show core MC methods with clean, runnable code and a brief finance angle.

## What’s here
- **Rejection sampling** — acceptance rate vs. proposal choice; quick timing.
- **Importance sampling** — stable/unstable weights; variance comparison.
- **MCMC basics** — simple chain with trace/ACF, effective sample size (ESS), R-hat.
- **(Optional) Option pricing via MC** — compare MC to Black–Scholes; error vs. paths.

## How to run
Open the notebooks in `notebooks/` and run cells top-to-bottom. Results save to `figures/` or `results/`.

## Notes
- This is a clean re-implementation of my coursework (not the assessed PDF).  
- Code is organised so you can lift the functions for other projects.
