# Monte Carlo Mini-Suite

Small, runnable demos of core Monte Carlo methods with clear outputs.

**Included**
- Rejection sampling — acceptance rate & timing
- Importance sampling — weight stability & variance
- MCMC diagnostics — trace, ACF, ESS, R-hat
- (Bonus) European option pricing via MC vs Black–Scholes

**Why**  
Show practical Monte Carlo techniques in concise, reproducible notebooks.  
See the [project overview](docs/overview.md) for context and notes.

## Quickstart
- Open `notebooks/` and run the demos.
- Outputs save to `figures/` / `results/`.
- Functions live in `src/`.
